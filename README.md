# 📊 Sales Prediction Model

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **Sales Prediction Model** developed during my one-month internship at **CodeAlpha**. The model leverages **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**, combined using a **Voting Regressor** to enhance prediction accuracy. It analyzes advertising data to predict sales, providing valuable insights for data-driven marketing decisions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data processing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning models

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is `Advertising.csv`, which contains information about advertising expenditures across different media and their impact on sales.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** - Handling missing values and unnecessary columns.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visualizing correlations and trends.
3. **Feature Selection & Engineering** - Identifying key influencing factors.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation** - Implementing and testing machine learning models.
5. **Performance Optimization & Feature Importance Analysis** - Refining model accuracy.

## ⚡ Model Implementation

- **Linear Regression**: A simple yet effective regression model.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: A robust ensemble model.
- **Voting Regressor**: A combination of both models to improve accuracy.

## 📈 Results & Performance Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Implementing more advanced regression models.
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
- Deploying the model as a web application.

## 🙌 Acknowledgment

This project was completed as part of my **CodeAlpha** internship, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to enhance my skills in **Machine Learning and Data Science**.
